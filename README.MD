# Portfolio Website

This website is now live at https://samuelgmunoz.com

This portfolio website showcases my work, skills, and achievements to potential clients or employers in a unique and engaging way. The website features a carousel built from scratch, an original layout, a preview of my recent open source works in the form of a safari window, and a language selection dropdown for my potential Spanish speaking clients. The contact page includes custom dropdowns to ensure a consistent experience across different browsers. I used my skills in web development and design to create a website that effectively showcases my work and highlights my talents.
